**Brief description**

I am a PhD student in Cohort 3 of the FIND-CDT, undertaking research work as part of the Pipebots project, which aims to populate buried pipes with many small, autonomous robots capable of traversing and navigating complex networks, capturing a variety of data describing pipe condition along the way. Specifically, my work is focused on testing the capability of air-coupled ultrasonic arrays in detecting a range of defects in the pipe wall, such as cracks, holes, corrosion and ovality, as well as blockages. The array is used to acquire Full Matrix Capture (FMC), which is processed to produce 3D images of features and defects in the pipe.
