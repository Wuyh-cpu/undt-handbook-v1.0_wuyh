**Engineering Doctorate (Eng. D)**-University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.

**Eng. D Project:** Eddy-Current inspection of complex geometries in carbon fibre composites.
Carbon fibre composites are used in many engineering industries, including aerospace, automotive, and the energy sector. Non-contact inductive (eddy-current) sensors have been shown to detect damage and manufacturing flaws in carbon fibre structures, however, the complex electromagnetic interaction with these multi-layered anisotropic fibrous structures is poorly understood, preventing accurate characterisation of critical mechanical properties such as fibre volume fraction. This research aims to develop finite element COMSOL models based on detailed multi-scale experimental characterisation (employing, micro-CT imaging and conductivity coupon testing) of the statistical variation in electro-structural properties of carbon fibre composite materials to more accurately model the eddy-current measurement of composite structures.

**Research Interest**- NDE, Bulk Ultrasonics, Eddy currents, Guided Waves, Composites, Structural Health Monitoring.

**Personal Hobbies**- Singing, Watching sci-fi movies, Reading physics books, Combining the concepts of science and spirituality.

**Brief description**

I am a PhD student in Cohort 3 of the FIND-CDT, undertaking research work as part of the Pipebots project, which aims to populate buried pipes with many small, autonomous robots capable of traversing and navigating complex networks, capturing a variety of data describing pipe condition along the way. Specifically, my work is focused on testing the capability of air-coupled ultrasonic arrays in detecting a range of defects in the pipe wall, such as cracks, holes, corrosion and ovality, as well as blockages. The array is used to acquire Full Matrix Capture (FMC), which is processed to produce 3D images of features and defects in the pipe.
