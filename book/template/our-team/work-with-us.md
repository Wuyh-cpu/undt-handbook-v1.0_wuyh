Carbon fibre composites are used in many engineering industries, including aerospace, automotive, and the energy sector. Non-contact inductive (eddy-current) sensors have been shown to detect damage and manufacturing flaws in carbon fibre structures, however, the complex electromagnetic interaction with these multi-layered anisotropic fibrous structures is poorly understood, preventing accurate characterisation of critical mechanical properties such as fibre volume fraction. This research aims to develop finite element COMSOL models based on detailed multi-scale experimental characterisation (employing, micro-CT imaging and conductivity coupon testing) of the statistical variation in electro-structural properties of carbon fibre composite materials to more accurately model the eddy-current measurement of composite structures.

**Brief description**

I am a PhD student in Cohort 3 of the FIND-CDT, undertaking research work as part of the Pipebots project, which aims to populate buried pipes with many small, autonomous robots capable of traversing and navigating complex networks, capturing a variety of data describing pipe condition along the way. Specifically, my work is focused on testing the capability of air-coupled ultrasonic arrays in detecting a range of defects in the pipe wall, such as cracks, holes, corrosion and ovality, as well as blockages. The array is used to acquire Full Matrix Capture (FMC), which is processed to produce 3D images of features and defects in the pipe.

Project title: Quantitative characterisation of metals using multiple scattering of ultrasonic waves

This project revolves around the exploitation of the multiple scattering phenomenon with respect to ultrasonic waves to quantitatively characterise microstructural properties of metallic materials. These include but are not limited to material grain size, shape, and the orientation of anisotropic crystals found in micro-textured regions.
There are several major advantages compared to traditional measurements using a single transducer. Firstly, the approach is based entirely on post-processing of the transmitter-receiver backscattered array data, and does not require any changes in array hardware or specific requirements regarding specimen geometry. Secondly, it is possible to extract data for desired local areas within the material, which implies the possibility of microstructural characterisation of each local material region. Finally, the method can also be used for detection and localisation of weak local material inhomogeneities, which are undetectable using conventional imaging (microtextured regions, creep damage etc.

**Brief description**

Project title: Defect Characterisation Using Ultrasonic Arrays

Over the last decades, there has been a rapid increase of using ultrasound arrays to detect and characterize defects. Particularly, post-processing imaging algorithms such as Total Focusing Method (TFM) can be used on a full set of captured matrix data (FMC) to perform high-resolution imaging. However, due to the diffraction of waves, the imaging resolution of ultrasound array is limited to around a wavelength of the ultrasound in use, and this leaves high uncertainty to small defect characterization from its ultrasound image. The scattering behavior from small defects can be extracted (scattering matrix) and used to characterise it. However, the accuracy of characterising procedure is affected by surrounding noise and defect surface condition such as roughness and asperities. This limits the real application of defect characterization using ultrasonic arrays in practice (within 0.1 wavelength accuracy). This project will look to develop a method to characterise defects more accurately by suppressing the effect from surrounding noise and defect surface condition.

Project descriptions: Metallic material grain structure characterization using ultrasonic arrays
A major barrier to characterise materials is the lack of techniques to measure material grain structure, mainly including grain size and its texture. Even using advanced ultrasonic phased arrays techniques such as FMC and total focused method (TFM), the defect image is still difficult to identify from the speckle image of material grain structure. As an example, Fig. 1 (a) shows an image from a steel specimen surface using microstructure morphology, and Fig. 1 (b) is a measured ultrasonic array image in which they do not directly allow the grain structure to be imaged. This limits the further understanding of the ultrasonic wave interactions between material grains and their ultrasonic signal and image performance. Therefore, the aim of this project is to develop ultrasonic array techniques to enable the material grain structure to be measured. The key is how to use ultrasonic phased arrays to capture data, control wave beamforming and postprocess the data to extract useful information such as material gain size and its texture.

**Brief description**
I was born in Vacoas, Mauritius in 1996. I studied Maths, Physics and Design and Technology for my A levels and was awarded the State of Mauritius scholarship in 2015 for my undergraduate study. Back in those days, I enjoyed doing all my A levels subjects, in particular design and technology where design and solving problem was one of the main requirements. This motivated me to choose mechanical engineering, as it is a combination of all the subjects I have enjoyed. I chose University of Bristol because it was among the top and already had some friends here. During my first year, I had Prof. Bruce Drinkwater as my supervisor, who has motivated me to achieve my best performance. I briefly worked as an intern for Arup for one month, and also as summer research intern before my final year. I enjoyed research and decided to do a PhD. My research interests are imaging with nonlinear ultrasound for early defect detection and understand its limitations. My supervisors are Prof. Bruce Drinkwater and Prof. Anthony Croxford. In my free times, I enjoy playing video games, long night walks and doing my research.
